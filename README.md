# Office Ally Patient Automation

## Project Overview

This project was created to automate the patient registration workflow in Office Ally CMS using Playwright.

The objective of this project is to reduce manual data entry by automating navigation to the Add New Patient page and preparing a workflow that can populate patient information using CSV-based test data.

The project was developed using Playwright Codegen to record browser actions, identify selectors, and understand the patient creation workflow.
